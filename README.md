- This project implements a sentiment analysis system to classify IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model leverages deep learning techniques to understand contextual and sequential patterns in natural language, making it well-suited for sentiment classification tasks.

- The IMDb dataset is preprocessed through tokenization, padding, and text normalization before being fed into the LSTM model. Word embeddings are used to capture semantic meaning, while the LSTM layer effectively handles long-term dependencies in review texts.

- The model is trained and evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy and loss.
